The system under consideration is a three-qubit chain that exhibits variation in qubit-qubit couplings and interaction strengths. As a consequence of these specific non-uniform interactions between the qubits, the system is referred to as an asymmetric chain and is characterised by the following Hamiltonian:\n",
